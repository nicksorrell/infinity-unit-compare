# Infinity N3/4 Unit Comparer
This app compares Infinity units in their N3 forms to their N4 forms.

It works by using preserved N3 data and the current N4 API data to load both versions of units side by side for comparison.

## Usage
This app was created using Create React App. The usual `npm start` and `npm run build` commands can be run to work with the code.
